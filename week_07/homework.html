        <h3>Homicides by Month</h3>
        <p>
            In 2015, more than 1,500 people were shot and killed 
            by police officers in the United States. 
            The following chart shows the monthly 
            variation in homicides. All months have 
            significantly high levels, above 100 killings. 
            March and July were the months with the highest 
            number of victims, while June has the lowest number.

        <h3>Top 10 of Cities with the larges number of Homicides</h3>
        <p>
            The top 10 cities with the highest number of 
            homicides include many of the most populated 
            cities, as well as, cities with high levels 
            of crime. However, it would be interesting to 
            compare the police homicide rate with other 
            data such as population, number of police 
            officers and the level of crime in the cities.

        <h3>Number of Homicides by Race and Gender</h3>
        <p>
            In terms of race, white males are the most 
            affected group, which is plausible considering 
            that they are also the largest population 
            group in the United States. The same is true 
            for African Americans and Latinos, the second 
            and third most representative population groups 
            in the United States. In terms of gender, 
            the affectation falls disproportionately on men.
