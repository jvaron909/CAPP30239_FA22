    </div>

    <div id="t4" class="introduction">
    The city council counts on 19 standing committees in charge of discussing specific pieces of legislation according to their subject. Intuitively, the quantity and quality of committees should be related to the nature of the legislation discussed, allowing the specialization of the legislative work. However, according to the Office of Inspector General's 2021 report, at least 7 chairmen were found to have employees, paid with committee’s appropriations, dedicated to non-committee business

      Chicago's structure of governance has been referred to as a strong mayor-weak council system. The City Council reports to the Mayor as she serves as its president and has significant powers such as appointing committee chairs, filling vacancies, and determining its operating budget, among other things. As a result of this imbalance of power, the Council's ability to actively debate the legislation presented is limited
